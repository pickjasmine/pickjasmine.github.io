<h1>Define and Describe JQuery</h1>
<a href="../index.html">Back to all assignments</a>

<p>What is JQuery?</p>
<p>JQuery is a JavaScript library. It basically takes things that are commonly done in JavaScript but require a lot of
    JS code and rewrites them. JQuery is still using JavaScript to achieve everything, but it
    puts that code into snippets that you can use without worrying about the behind the scenes work.</p>

<p>What do they mean by a library?</p>
<p>A library is a set of pre-written Javascript code snippets that are used to speed up the development process. Like
    said above, JQuery uses JavaScript to create easier to use code snippets that accomplish different things. Some of
    the things that libraries make easier are AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>

<p>What are some of the advantages of JQuery?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Way less code to accomplish cool things</li>
    <li>Easier DOM traversal and manipulation</li>
    <li>Easier event handling</li>
    <li>Pre-made functions to accomplish cool animations</li>
    <li>Pre-made widgets, like date pickers</li>
    <li>Widely used, good cross-browser support</li>
</ul>

<p>What are some of the disadvantages of JQuery?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learning curve</li>
    <li>Lots of reading API documentation to get a good understanding</li>
    <li>Tons of functions, meaning you have to know what to Google</li>
    <li>Need a CDN or a local version of the library to use</li>
    <li>If JQuery doesn't have a solution to your problem, you have to write it yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>List and describe three or more examples of JQuery libraries?</p>
<dl>
    <dt>1. JQuery UI</dt>
    <dd>JQuery UI focuses on, you guessed it, the user interface side of things. It offers widgets, interactions like
        drag and drop, and special effects to help you create a better user experience. All of their widgets are fully
        customizable to fit the color scheme or themes of your website, but there are also pre-built styles if you are
        looking purely for the widget's functionality.
    </dd>

    <dt>2. JQuery Mobile</dt>
    <dd>JQuery Mobile is a library that helps you create websites and app that are mobile friendly. It takes the guess
        work out of making sure your website or app is responsive. JQuery Mobile provides the same services as JQuery,
        so widgets and the like, because it is built on JQuery. Basically it is JQuery optimized for responsive design.
    </dd>

    <dt>3. QUnit</dt>
    <dd>QUnit is a testing library built on JQuery. It provides easy to use JavaScript based tools to create tests, and
        handles all things testing, like assertions and callbacks, with similar to JQuery syntax. If you are already
        familiar with JQuery, beggining the use of QUnit would be an easy transition into unit testing.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>How does JQuery relate to and interact with Javascript?</p>
<p>JQuery is literally JavaScript code, just compartmentalized into functions and objects. When you use JQuery, you are
    still using JavaScript, and you often have to write your own JavaScript code(just a little bit) to utilize the full
    power of its functions and objects.</p>
