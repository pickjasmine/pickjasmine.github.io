    <h1>Research Shopping Cart Applications</h1>
    <h2>What are some of the most common shopping cart applications?</h2>
    <p>Some applications that came up on almost every list I looked at were Shopify, PinnacleCart, and Magento, but
        there
        are literally hundreds of different shopping cart applications to choose from. Some specialize in mobile-focused
        apps, while others focus on selling through sites like Facebook or Twitter.</p>


    <h2>Identify the main features found in many shopping cart applications.</h2>
    <p>Commons features include :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Website shopping cart feature</li>
        <li>Website builder/templates for stores</li>
        <li>Mobile app capabilities</li>
        <li>Discounts and coupons</li>
        <li>SSL certificates</li>
        <li>Customer Support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features varied from site to site. Many of the shopping cart applications only offered these features with
        their paid/more premium packages of their software.</p>


    <h2>Discuss some of the pricing options for this type of software.</h2>
    <p>Most applications I looked at had either 3 or 4 tiers of service. The lowest tier, usually a free tier, would
        only include the absolute necessities to your site (the shopping cart itself, maybe a website builder with some
        templates). The free tier often limits the amount of products that can be listed on a site.</p>
    <p>The next tier is what I will call the "economy tier". It's the cheapest of the options, and provides
        more to both the store owner and the user. This tier usually included customer support for the shopping
        cart/point of sale features and also includes some more customization options on the store owners end. This tier
        also
        usually included an increase in the number of products that can be listed. The economy tier or the next tier up
        also
        tended to include the ability to sell digital goods, if it were not already included in the free tier.</p>
    <p>The next tier or the top tiers are all kind of meshed together here. If there are four tiers to choose from, the
        biggest difference between the two is usually the number of products that can be sold and the quality of
        customer service offered. This(these) tier(s) will usually also include more website templates. </p>
    <p>Pricing betweens tiers differed dramatically across the different applications. Some applications charged flat
        fees per month, including transaction fees, while others had yearly subscriptions with varying transaction fees,
        depending on the tier. </p>


    <h2>Discuss some of the issues with this type of software.</h2>
    <p>Issues that come with using these applications are the same with using any third party application. You have to
        trust that the company making this application has fully tested it across browsers and devices. You have to
        trust that the company is keeping up with government standards. You have to trust that the company isn't going
        to just stop supporting it's users out of the blue.</p>
    <p>There are also some more issues that come with the applications that build websites, including the possibility of
        your website looking just like another business's site. You will likely not have as much customization and
        ability to change code to fit your needs, when using these types of applications. </p>


    <h2>Discuss some of the reasons you would choose to use or not use this type of software.</h2>
    <p>Some reasons I would choose to use a shopping cart application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why reinvent the wheel?</li>
        <li>Reasonable pricing</li>
        <li>Customer support of shopping cart software is dependent on the application company, so less for you to worry about</li>
        <li>Can provide seamless transition between product catalog and check-out; improved UX</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some reasons why I wouldn't choose to use a shopping cart application: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Third party software forces you to put your fate and faith into the hands of another company</li>
        <li>Less customization for my site</li>
        <li>If I'm a small business, the costs of a shopping cart application may not be worth it</li>
    </ul>
