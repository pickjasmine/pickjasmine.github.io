<h1>Document Object Model Review</h1>

<h2>Document Object: </h2>
<p>The Document Object holds every HTML element on a webpage. The Document Object Model (DOM) is structured like a tree
    due to HTML element's hierarchical nature. The DOM is an essential part of JavaScript because it allows us to call
    and act upon any HTML element we desire. </p>

<h2>How does the browser render your HTML and CSS into the document object?</h2>
<p>The browser starts by going through your code and looking for the HTML, specifically the tags. Your browser takes
    these tags and converts them into "nodes" (explained below). The browser, after creating all of these nodes,
    arranges them into the "tree structure", AKA the Document Object Model. The DOM is now it's own entity, which the
    browser will put aside for now. The browser then goes through the CSS and does the same thing, creating CSS nodes
    and arranging them into what is known as the CSS Object Model (CSSOM). The structure of the CSSOM isn't identical to
    the DOM; it is structured according to your CSS style rules. (This is not super important right now, just something
    to look at in the future.)</p>
<p>After the DOM and CSSOM are created, they are merged together into something called the "render tree". The render
    tree takes all the nodes that are to be shown on this web page and computes the exact size and position of each
    node. Finally, the web page is "painted" to match the render tree, applying the HTML contents and CSS style rules to
    each node.</p>

<h2>Node: </h2>
<p>Nodes are bits of information within the DOM and CSSOM. When the browser is first going through your code, it is
    reading raw bytes of information, which it then interprets as characters, like &lt;head&gt;. After interpreting
    these characters, the browser recognizes these as disinct "tokens", seeing that &lt;head&gt; is a starting head tag.
    The browser takes these tokens and creates the node, utilizing both start and end tokens to see which elements are
    children of another element.</p>

<h2>Tree Structure: </h2>
<p>The tree structure is made to reflect the hierarchy of your HTML tags. The HTML tag is at the top, as it encompasses
    all of the tags in a webpage. The HTML tag is the parent to two tags, the head and the body. This will be the same
    on every webpage, because they are necessary to properly make any webpage. The head and body are considered to be
    children of the HTML tag. When I imagine the tree structure, I put each tag into a circle and draw a line below to
    each tag that comes before your closing tag. Every tag within the body will be a child (or grandchild,
    great-grandchild, etc). of the body, same with the head. The head will likely only contain link nodes, script nodes,
    meta nodes, and a title node.</p>

<h2>Event model or event handlers: </h2>
<p>The event model or event handlers are a way to delay the running of a function until a certain action has been
    performed. The easiest event handler to imagine is "onclick", meaning that when you click on a special element, it
    will trigger a function. This adds a unique ability that was not possible with HTML and CSS alone. There are a ton
    of different event handlers that you can use to trigger a function, but there are also many properties you can
    access regarding events that you can use. One example of a property you might access is timeStamp, giving you the
    exact time that the event was triggered.</p>
