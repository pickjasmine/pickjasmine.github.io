        <h2>What are the general recommendations for using 2D transformations?</h2>
        <p>2D transformations occur when you use the transform property. This property can take on values
            of translate,
            skew,
            scale, and rotate. When using 2D transformations, you want to need to be aware of your X and Y axis and how
            translate and skew will affect your element along each axis. You also want to be aware of the size and
            placement
            changes that come with using scale and rotate. Using these properties may interfere with the currently
            layout of
            your website.</p>

        <h2>What issues need to be considered and addressed when using 2D transformations?</h2>
        <p>Transformation properties aren't cross-browser supported declarations, so you have to properly
            "declare" your
            property before you will see any effects. For example, using the transform property on Chrome, you must
            declare
            -webkit-transform: (value) or your effects won't show up when viewing the webpage on Chrome.</p>

        <h2>What are the general recommendations for using 3D transformations?</h2>
        <p>3D transformations take all of the features of 2D transformations and add in a new axis
            (Z-axis). The Z-axis is
            what creates the third dimension. 3D transformation will take all the properties that 2D uses, but may
            require
            an
            extra
            inserted value to create the 3D effect. Like 2D transformations, you need to be aware of each axis and how
            the
            properties will respond on each. Using scale, rotate, and skew may create some interference with other
            elements
            on
            your page.</p>

        <h2>What issues need to be considered and addressed when using 3D transformations?</h2>
        <p>Same as with 2D transformations, you must appropriately declare your properties to ensure that
            they show up for
            multiple web browsers. There are also some browsers that do not support 3D transformations at all, so if it
            is
            an
            essential part of your webpage you need to substitute another element in place of your 3D transformation.
            You
            also
            need to be aware, like stated above, of the space that your transformation is taking on your webpage.
            Transformations may interfere with other content on your page in an unpleasant way. </p>
