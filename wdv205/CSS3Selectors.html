<h1>CSS3 Selectors</h1>

    <div><h3>1. element1~element2:</h3>
        <p>This selector might be used on a webpage with lots of content that is divided into sections.  For example, in a list
    article that has headers(h2) and subheadings(h3), you may want to include a comment(p) after some subheadings. You
    could use this selector to make those comments a unique style without affecting the other p tags. Keep in mind, you
        must separate your page into divs in order for this to be effective. <br>
    This is demonstrated on this webpage in the odd numbered list items. Odd numbered list items use h3 tags, and even
    number items use h2 tags. I use p~h3 to select all p tags that are preceded by h3s, so only odd numbered paragraphs
    are affected by the style rule.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>2. element[attribute^=value]</h2>
        <p>This selector will select only the given elements with an attribute equal to the given value.  This might be
    useful when you are trying to select images with specific height values or specific titles.  This can also work
    to select attributes that begin with the same value. The example given on W3Cschools is a[href^="https"], meaning
    ever a tag that has a href beginning with https will be affected by the styles rules you apply.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>3. element[attribute$=value]</h3>
    <p>Similar to #2, this selector will select all elements whose attribute ends with the given value.  This is used when
    you want to apply specific styles to .pdf files and .zip files, without the need for classes. An example of the code
    for this example: a[href$=".jpg"].  This will select all links that are .jpg files and apply rules to those links
    only.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>4. element[attribute*=value]</h2>
    <p>Again, similar to the two listed above, this selector will select all elements whose attribute contains the
    given value.  This is extremely useful if you want to highlight only specific links on your page. Say, for example,
    you have a deal with the Washington Post to make any of their links on your site a flashy color.  Instead of
    creating a class only for this, you can use this selector to accomplish your task.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>5. element: first-of-type</h3>
    <p>This selector will apply style rules only to the first element of its parent. You might use this if you have a
    bunch of lists, and you want the first list item(li) on each to stand out. You would utilize this by declaring
    li:first-of-type. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>6. :not(selector)</h2>
    <p>This selector is very straightforward; it selects all elements that is not the one you specified.  If you want to
     select everything that is not an h1-tag, you would type :not(h1).  If you're having troubles with the not(selector)
        make sure that you specify a style for the undesired element, as that element might be inheriting a style from
        another element, which cancels out the effect.  This selector is demonstrated on this page; all non-p
        elements have been bolded.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>7. :in-range</h3>
    <p>This selector will affect elements with a value within the given range.  This can only be applied to elements
    that have specific ranges. An easy example to relate to (shown below) is a box that takes input numbers. When the
    number entered is between a specified range (in this case, between 5 and 10), the box will have a different style
    than when an out-of-range number is entered.</p>
    </div>

    <input type="number" height="2" width="4" min="5" max="10" value="4">

    <div>
    <h2>8. :out-of-range</h2>
    <p>Similar to in-range, this selector can only be applied to elements with specific ranges. It will select elements
    that are out of the given range for those elements.  In the same example as above, you will see that when a number is
    entered outside of the given range (5 to 10), the box turns from green to red.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>9. :last-child</h3>
    <p>This selector will select every specified element that is the last child of its parent. Say you have a webpage
    with multiple sections. Each section(div) has multiple paragraphs(p). You want to apply a border at the bottom of
        each section, and you can do so using p:last-child. This will select that last p tag in each div to apply
        a border to.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>10. :nth-child(n)</h2>
    <p>This selector is similar to last-child, but it specifies which numbered child you want to affect.  An example:
        You are a wedding photographer trying to set up your website. You have a page that shows previews from each
        wedding(each wedding has its own div), but the third picture you have displayed is always a picture of the
        couple kissing. You want to apply a special style to the kissing picture (the third picture)in each set. You
        will use the code img:nthchild(3) to select only the third image under each div.</p>
    </div>
</div>
