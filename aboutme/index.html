<p>
    I am currently studying Web Development at Des Moines Area Community College.
    I became interested in programming after taking a Java class during my last semester
    at Iowa State University, where I graduated with a degree in Business Economics. I really
    enjoyed my Java class, and the experience pushed me to pursue a career in programming.
