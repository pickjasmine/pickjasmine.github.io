<h2>What is the difference between SASS syntax and SCSS syntax?</h2>
<p>Both are syntaxes for CSS preprocessors. SCSS is an extension of CSS, meaning all
CSS files are also valid SCSS files. SCSS uses the same brackets, commas, etc. as CSS to indicate style rules. SASS, on
    the other hand, is a syntax that uses indents and other punctuation to indicate style rules. Although
they are different syntaxes, they can both accomplish the same tasks; using one over the other depends on personal
preference.</p>
