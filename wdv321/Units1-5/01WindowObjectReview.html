<h1>Window Object Review</h1>

<h2>Window Object: </h2>
<p>The window object is essentially the browser window, as the window object is the primary object of the
    browser. Any functions you call that begin with "window", such as window.alert() do not have to formally announce
    the window object because it is the primary object of the browser. The window object is rarely used directly, but it
    is the
    parent of the other objects in this list.</p>
<p>The window object has several methods, including print() (print the window contents), alert() (displays an dialog
    box alert), confirm() (displays a confirm dialog box with 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons), prompt() (dialog box which
    asks for input from the user), open() (opens a new window), close() (closes that window), and setTimeout() (performs
    an action at a specified time).</p>

<h2>Navigator Object: </h2>
<p>The navigator object is primarily used to get information about the user's browser because it has few defined methods
    but many properties. However, the navigator object is becoming less and less important because the information
    available through the navigator object can now be obtained through the server. It still does provide useful
    information though, such as the name and version of the browser and whether or not the user has cookies enabled. The
    navigator object can also tell you if the user has java enabled. These properties are useful in telling whether or
    not your website or application will run as expected on the user's browser.</p>
<p>The navigator object was extremely useful when browser incompatibility was a large issue, as it could distinguish
    which browser was running, and then run code specific to that browser. The navigator object also has the ability to
    distinguish the language the user is using on their browser, so language-specific code can be assigned according to
    that property as well.</p>

<h2>Location Object: </h2>
<p>The location object has information about the current window's URL. This object was a little more difficult to find
    good information on, relative to the other window objects, but it has methods related to exactly what you would
    expect from an object that holds info about the current URL: you can replace() the current URL, reload() the URL, or
    assign() the URL. All of these methods will only affect the current window.</p>
<p>There are several properties of the location object, some useful ones include the host and hostname, origin, port,
    and protocol of the current URL. These might be useful if you are looking for secure websites or if you want to
    block users websites that are coming from a specific host.</p>

<h2>Screen Object: </h2>
<p>The screen object is frequently used, as it holds information about the device screen of the user.
    There are no defined methods associated with the screen object, but there are several properties of importance.
    Height and width, as well as available height (availHeight) and available width (availWidth) are used in media
    queries to determine what the user will see. ColorDepth and pixelDepth are also available properties to access. </p>

<h2>History Object: </h2>
<p>The history object provides information about the URLS visited by the user, including any URLs that are "forward in
    time", AKA if you press the back arrow, you can press the forward arrow and it will likely still work. Some websites
    erase the history object so you cannot go back or forward when you're on their site. The history object has one
    property, length, that tells you the number of URLS currently in the history object. </p>
<p>The methods of the history object include back(), forward(), and go(), all doing what you would expect them to do.
    The history object can be changed by the user very easily. It is, in my opinion, the easiest object to understand
    because it is something that most people have contact with on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Document Object: </h2>
<p>The document object is the most complex object on the list, because it holds every HTML element on a page. The
    Document Object Model (the DOM) maps out all HTML elements on a page according to their placement in the webpage,
    forming what looks like an upside down tree. All elements stem from the "base", AKA the HTML tag, which splits into
    the head and the body, and continuing to every HTML tag on a webpage. As you can imagine, this gets very
    intricate.</p>
<p>The DOM is extremely important in JavaScript because it allows you to call and act upon any element on a webpage by
    following the tree-like structure. There are way too many methods and properties associated with the document object
    to list, but some that we use a lot are document.getElementById, document.write(), and document.<em>element</em>.innerHTML().
