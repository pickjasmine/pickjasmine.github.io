            <h2 class="align-center">Who wrote or supports the framework?</h2>
            <p>Ink was made and is maintained by a Portuguese company called Sapo. Ink is an open source initiative, so
                anyone can add functionality and features to the framework as they see fit.</p>

            <h2 class="align-center">Briefly describe the framework and its primary features.</h2>
            <p>Ink is based around the idea of easy web development, with an emphasis on layouts. Ink strives to achieve
                easy to read class and variable names, and produces the most commonly used web elements to be used by
                developers and hobbyists alike. Ink provides features that most frameworks do, including tables, forms,
                images with captions, buttons, etc. The ink grid is very easy to use, and using it in combination with
                the flexbox features of Ink make styling pages very easy.</p>

            <h2 class="align-center">What are some of the advantages/disadvantages to using this framework?</h2>
            <p class="all-50">Advantages: very customizable for someone with specific wants/needs, easy to read and
                understand at first glance, has a grid/flexbox combo for easy specific location styling of elements,
                very easy to nest grid elements </p>
            <p class="all-50">Disadvantages: no pre-built fancy nav bars/footers/etc; you have to add classes to what
                you have already hardcoded, pre-built examples on their page are for very basic items; it's up to
                you to add any fanciness to the webpage.</p>

            <h2 class="align-center">What are some of the primary features or pre-built functions of this
                framework?</h2>
            <p>The ink grid isn't based on "columns", it is based on a 5% to 100% scale, using 5% increments in between.
                This adds a lot of customization to your page that other frameworks don't always provide. For those who
                do not want to mess with the colorization and design aspect, Ink offers colorful themes that you add by
                just adding a class to the appropriate elements.</p>
            <h2 class="align-center">Who's using Ink?</h2>
            <p>Because of Ink's Portuguese background, many Portuguese companies use the Ink framework, including the
                creators <a href="http://sobre.sapo.pt/pt-pt">Sapo</a>,
                <a href="https://music.meo.pt/">Meo Music</a>, and <a href="http://lifestyle.sapo.pt">Sapo LifeStyle</a>.
