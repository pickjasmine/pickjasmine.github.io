    <h2>What are the general recommendations for animations?</h2>
    <p>Animations are used in situations where you want multiple stages/transformations/transitions over a specified
        amount
        of time. The @keyframes property is what defines an animation from a transition. There are several keyframe
        properties that can be applied to your animation, including timing delays, direction of animation, and number of
        animation repetitions. Animations are not universal across browsers, so be sure to include the proper prefixes
        for
        each browser you want to support. </p>

    <h2>What issues need to be considered and addressed when using animations?</h2>
    <p>There are several elements which can be element, but there several which cannot. The list of animatable
        properties
        can be found <a class="inline" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties">here.</a> When
        using
        animations, you must always specify an animation-duration, or you will not see the animation. It is also
        important
        to know where to put your animation properties, either in the designated animation div or the @keyframes
        property.
