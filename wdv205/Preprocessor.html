<h1>CSS Preprocessors</h1>
    <h2>What does a CSS Preprocessor do?</h2>
        <p>Preprocessors extend CSS to include new abilities, such as variables and mixins, which make styling large
        projects much easier. Preprocessors take scss files and transform them into css files that are readable by
        all web browsers.</p>
    <h2>What are the advantages of using a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
        <p>Easier to manage large amounts of CSS files, little learning curve from original CSS (if you use SCSS syntax)
            , can easily add mixins that will make it easier to apply CSS3 styles that can be seen on all browsers.</p>
    <h2>What are the disadvantages or issues you need to consider when using a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
        <p>Learning a new "language" (not really a whole language, but the syntax), learning curve for using the
        command prompt</p>
    <h2>List at least FIVE CSS Preprocessors currently available.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sass</li>
            <li>Less.js</li>
            <li>Stylus</li>
            <li>CSS Crush</li>
            <li>Myth</li>
            <li>Rework</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Research Web Development jobs and see how many of them list a CSS Preprocessor as one of their desired skills.</h2>
        <p>Lots of Web Development jobs want CSS experience and CSS Preprocessor knowledge , especially those focusing
            on front-end development.</p>
