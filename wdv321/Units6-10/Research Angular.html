<h1>Research Angular</h1>
<p>What is a Framework?</p>
<p class="indent">A framework is basically a set of tools used by a developer to do things easier than writing the vanilla versions of
    code. Frameworks usually encapsulate functionality that a lot of people try to accomplish and rewrites them into
    functions or features that the developer can easily use. There are a lot of well known frameworks, including
    Angular, JQuery, React, and Vue, that accomplish a wide variety of things. There are frameworks that focus around
    front-end development, like React, Jquery, and Vue, and other frameworks that are meant to be used throughout an
    entire application, like Angular.</p>

<p>Why would you use the ANGULAR Framework?</p>
<p class="indent">The Angular framework is meant to be used for your entire application, front end to back end. It heavily emphasizes
    the MVC concept, which makes finding issues and the location of code much easier. It is also intended for
    reusability in large applications, meaning that changing an item across a large webpage will only require changing a
    few files, vs changing the code wherever that item is used.</p>

<p>What are some of the advantages of using a Framework?</p>
<p class="indent">Frameworks tend to be well tested, and they cut down dramatically on the amount of code needed to accomplish a task.
    For large scale applications, frameworks make maintenance and debugging much easier than writing in only vanilla JS.
    Frameworks can also provide functionality that may be difficult for you to achieve yourself, so they can be
    extremely useful to newer and older developers alike.</p>

<p>What are some of the disadvantages of using a Framework?</p>
<p class="indent">Disadvantages are the same as any third party platform. If the maintainers of a framework decide to abandon the
    project, you are left with a codebase that will quickly go out to date. You also have to make sure that you are
    looking out for the latest version of that framework. Frameworks also come with a learning curve, and possibily
    limitations on what you can accomplish. With Angular, it is very difficult to incorporate it into a legacy system
    because the framework was intended to be used throughout the entire application.</p>

<p>Define the key terms for ANGULAR identified above.</p>
<p class="indent">Singe Page Web Applications: pretty self explanatory. A web application that rests entirely on a single web page, no
    routing to other URLs.</p>
<p class="indent">MVC: Model View Controller is a way of organizing your code. It separates the data from the logic and the visuals, so
    debugging and finding specific items in your code is (hopefully) easier.</p>
<p class="indent">MVVM: Model-view-viewmodel is a concept similar to MVC, it is a way or organizing your code. However, the "layers" of
    your code are slightly more abstracted. The Model layer is accessing your data; it will likely be the layer
    communication with your database. The View is the same as MVC, it is the display of your data. The Viewmodel is
    (from what I've read), the same as the controller, except that instead of talking directing to the view, it
    communicates through a "binder". This separates the View from the logic and functioning layer, and allows for better
    testing because you are not relying on either layer to contain a specific set of data. The binder is what
    connections the view to the view model.</p>
<p class="indent">Components are individual pieces of your application. They can be "physical" pieces, like a nav bar, or they can be
    information pieces like an object holding lots of information.</p>
<p class="indent">Dependency injection: this concept is fairly abstract to me, but my understanding is that it separates the need for
    pieces of your program to interact with eachother directly. Instead of having one function call another function,
    you may pass that function as an arguement and use it instead. When you are testing, you do not need to access
    multiple functions, you only need to test the single function and pass in a fake function to substitute the other
    functionality. </p>
<p class="indent">"Dependency injection for five-year-olds:
    When you go and get things out of the refrigerator for yourself, you can cause problems. You might leave the door
    open, you might get something Mommy or Daddy doesn't want you to have. You might even be looking for something we
    don't even have or which has expired.

    What you should be doing is stating a need, "I need something to drink with lunch," and then we will make sure you
    have something when you sit down to eat.

<p>Research and describe two or three alternative Javscript Frameworks compared to ANGULAR.</p>
<p class="indent">React: Similar to Angular, in that it is a framework designed to make large scale applications easy to maintain.
    However, React is primarily a front-end framework, creating dynamic UIs that depend on the "state" of the
    application. React is great for single page websites, and quick loading with it's one way binding. It is an entirely
    new way of thinking about your application from either top-down or bottom-up.</p>
<p class="indent">JQuery is not super similar to Angular or React. JQuery has become a standard library for JS because it simplifies
    many things, such as Ajax calls and animations. You could write your whole website in JQuery, but it will not
    produce the same "efficiencies" as writing it in React or Angular. JQuery simplifies DOM element specification and
    other common JS practices, but it does not provide any real basis for improving the organization or functionality of
    your code, outside of cutting down the amount you will be typing.</p>
