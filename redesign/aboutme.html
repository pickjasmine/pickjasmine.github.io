    <p>I am a student studying Web Development at Des Moines Area Community College.</p>
    <p>I became interested in programming after taking a Java class during my last semester at Iowa State University,
        where I studied Business Economics.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed my first encounter with programming, and that class, combined with my internship in project
        management, led me to pursue a career in programming.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Software Development Intern In-Test at Xpanxion.</p>
