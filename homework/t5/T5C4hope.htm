<h1>Planet Hope: Government and Lifestyle Proposal</h1>

<p>Planet Hope is the second chance for humans to create and conduct life on a completely new planet.
    After the destruction of many countries on Earth through war and pollution, we have been desperate
    to find a new home that will allow us to rebuild and learn from our past mistakes.<br>
    In order to effectively run Planet Hope, I have written this brief proposal as to how to conduct
    basic affairs on the new planet. There are 5 basic ideas included in this proposal that Planet Hope
    will follow in order to maximize efficiency and safety: Colonization, Government, Environment, Business, and Education.</p>

<h2>Colonization</h2>
<p class="right">
    Colonization of Planet Hope will take course over 12 months. <br>
    In Month 1, the remaining Earth population will
    voluntarily take a basic human skills and decency test.  These tests are voluntary, so anyone who does not wish to
    associate with Planet Hope will not be forced to do so.  The tests measure human value through skills,
    such as (but not limited to) basic intelligence, physical ability, compassion, and knowledge of agriculture and business.
    Children under the age of 10 are not forced to take the tests, but are encouraged to do so at their free-will.<br>
    Months 2 and 3 include grading and sending out acceptance messages to those who participated in taking the tests.<br>
    Months 4 through 12 will be the gradual process of leaving Earth for Planet Hope.

</p>

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>
    Government on Planet Hope will be a simple council and democracy system.  Everyone above the age of 13 has the legal right to vote
    on issues, but the final fate of law enactment and enforcement will be left to the council.  <br>
    The council will consist of 15 members, covering a variety of ages.  There are no criteria needed in order to serve on the council, but
     each member must be voted in by majority by their colony in order to show that colony's faith in the performance of said council member.
    Council members will hold term for no longer than 3 years, at which they must wait 5 more years before being eligible for re-election.<br>
    It is each person's right and obligation to vote on issues.  Declining to vote will result in a fine or punishment to be decided by the
    public.  Although Planet Hope is a free planet, your participation as a member of society is crucial in keeping the planet truly democratic.
</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<p class="right">
    After the harsh fate of the planet Earth, the environment takes precendence over almost all other issues.  The first
    few months of colonization and living will be spent in a state of environmental-frugality, as we establish renewable resources
    and solve any issues that might be caused by our presence. In order to conduct any affair, be in business or personal, it must abide
    by strict environmental regulations.  Those caught violating those regulations will be punished democratically.<br>
    There will also be an annual festival on Planet Hope that celebrates the environment and improves our well-being.  The festival
    activities will change from year to year, but there will always be a tree-planting ceremony accompanied with a clean-up event so as to
    keep our planet beautiful.

</p>

<h2>Business</h2>
<p>
    Business will be conducted with the environment in mind.  Any business breaking the environmental rules will face consequences
    picked by the council.  This is the only situation where the public will not be forced to vote upon.  Business must act with high
    moral and ethical codes, ensuring that they conduct business in an admiral way.  Businesses must treat their employees with respect and
    give adequate time off for personal reasons, maternity/paternity leave, and sickness.  Any Business caught violating this will
    face the council's judgement.
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p class="right">
    All children will be required to attend school until they have completed 12 years of schooling.  After that period, young adults
    will have the option of attending college to learn abstract ideas, such as science, business, or math, or they can attend trade
    school to learn a technical skill, such a plumbing or programming.  In order to add value to our society, this secondary school
    attendance will be mandatory for the first 100 years of Planet Hope's inhabitance, to ensure that everyone is contributing to
    our society. After those 100 years, the issue will be brought to the council and the public to be discussed and resolved for
    future generations.
