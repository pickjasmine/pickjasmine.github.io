<h1>CSS3 Definitions</h1>
<h2>Specificity</h2>
    <p>Specificity determines which style will be applied to an element that has more than one style rule that applies.
    Only one style rule can apply to an element, so specificity is calculated according to which type(s) of selector
    is used.  Specificity is especially important when dealing with large style sheets, where there are multiple rules
    that may deal with the same selector.
    </p>
    <p> An example:<br>
    p{color: blue;}<br>
    Div p {color: red;} <br>
    These rules both apply to the p-tag, but Div p has a higher specificity according to specificity calculators
    online because two selectors have higher specificity than a single selector.  Classes have higher selectors than
    single HTML selectors, and IDs have higher selectors than a class.
    </p>

<h2>Precedence</h2>
    <p>Precedence is highly related to specificity; they have almost identical functions in that they both are used to
    determine which style rule will apply to an element. Precedence says that some selectors are more “important” than
    other, so their rules will apply over others. Similar to the specificity, IDs have higher precedence than classes,
    and classes have higher precedence than normal selectors.
    </p>
    <p>Precedence is also important when use inline or embedded CSS.  An easy way to remember the precedence order
    regarding location of CSS is “the closer it is to the HTML, the higher the precedence.”  Inline CSS takes
    precedence over embedded CSS, which takes precedence over external CSS.
    </p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance occurs when an element “inherits” a rule from another element, usually these are referred to as
        child and parent elements.  Inheritance allows elements to use rules that are not explicitly stated in your
        document and reduces the amount of code in a style sheet (when used effectively).  Inheritance is great when
        applying styles to a div or to containing elements, so you don’t have to specify rules for every element
            within each container or section.
    </p>
    <p>An example of inheritance: if you have a div tag that wraps about an h1 and p tag, any rule that is applied to
        the div will be inherited by those h1 and p tags within the div. However, once a rule is applied to the h1
            or p tag that conflicts with a div rule, the h1 or p tag rule will take precedence over the div rule.
    </p>

<h2>Selector, Property and Value</h2>
    <p>The set up for a style rule is:<br>
        Selector { Property: Value; }</p>
    <p>Selectors are declaring what element you want the following rules to be applied to. A selector can be an HTML
        element, an ID, a class,or any number of other selectors, such as a psuedo-class selector.  With the
    introduction of CSS3, there are a lot of selectors to choose from to fully customize your webpage.  </p>
    <p>The property is what you are changing. Some typical properties you would change include font or background-color,
        but there are tons of different properties you can select from, depending on the type of selector you are
        modifying.</p>
    <p>The value is how you plan on changing the property. In the font example, you can apply font-weights (like bold
        or light), font-sizes, font-families, font-styles (like italics), etc.  For some properties, there are very
        specific values that need to be inputted in order for the style rule to correctly apply.
