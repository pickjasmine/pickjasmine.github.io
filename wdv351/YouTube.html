<h1>YouTube Video Review</h1>
<h2>In general how does YouTube.com work?</h2>
<p>YouTube is <em>the</em> website for uploading and watching videos. YouTube accepts a wide variety of file formats and
    video contents, but it is vigilant about copyright infringement.</p>

<h2>What is required by you in order to view videos on YouTube?</h2>
<p>Anyone can watch YouTube videos, as long as they have a connection to the internet. YouTube's system preferences for
    watching their videos suggests having the most recent version of your preferred browser and an internet connection
    of minimum 500 kbps. If you don't have the latest browser, then you need to at least have the latest version of
    Adobe Flash Player. If you watch to watch live streams, they suggest a faster internet connection and a more recent
    OS on your computer. (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/78358?hl=en) </p>

<h2>What is required by you in order to post videos on YouTube?</h2>
<p>Anyone can upload a video to YouTube, but first they need to make an account. Since YouTube is now owned by Google,
    you can use your gmail to create an account. If you do not have a gmail, you will be prompted to make one in order
    to upload videos. (https://lifehacker.com/5804501/how-to-upload-videos-to-youtube-for-beginners) </p>

<h2>What is YouTube's position on copyright protection, video ownership, privacy and security of the videos that you have
    posted to YouTube?</h2>
<p>Copyright protection is very important to YouTube. There are lots of ways to report copyright infringement on the
    site, as well as YouTube's own copyright vigilance to reduce copyright infringement. YouTube has "robots" that look
    for copyright infringement. Companies can also give copies of copyrighted materials to YouTube that YouTube will use
    for "Content ID matching", where YouTube can compare any video that is uploaded to these copies and look for
    copyright violations.</p>
<p>Video ownership with YouTube is a weird topic, because although you technically still have ownership over any videos
    you upload, the YouTube Terms of Service state that by uploading a video, you give YouTube the license to use that
    video in any way they want. Other people also now have the license to use your video for personal use.

<p>Privacy and security are somewhat important to YouTube. If you feel like a video has violated your privacy, say by
    revealing personal information about you, you can report it to YouTube but only after you have contacted the
    uploader asking
    them to remove the video. YouTube allows you to upload videos with different privacy settings as well.</p>

<h2>What video formats does YouTube allow when posting a video to YouTube? Discuss what YouTube does with your uploaded
    video.</h2>
<p>YouTube accepts the following formats: MOV, .MPEG4, MP4, .AVI, .WMV, .MPEGPS, .FLV, 3GPP, and WebM. YouTube once upon
    a time allows people to upload files that were primarily audio or visual, but they are doing away with that.

<p>When you upload a video to YouTube, YouTube creates a bunch of copies of your video in different video formats and
    creates packets out of them. It then transmits those packets over a wireless connection, where it will meet with a
    cell tower or router. After hitting the tower or router, the packets are transmitted to YouTube's servers through
    physical connections. YouTube stores your video in the server that is closest to you, until someone else watches
    your video, where it will be copied to the server closest to them. This process ensures that videos are backed-up in
    case of any potential problems with the server.

<h2>What video formats does YouTube use when playing videos?</h2>
<p>YouTube converts all videos uploaded to the site into an Adobe Flash video format, with the .FLV file extension. This
    the the only type of video that will play within a YouTube video player.</p>

<h2>Find the code for a YouTube player. How does YouTube implement their video player?</h2>
<p>Wherever they can, YouTube will use HTML5 to display their videos. If you want to embed a video player into a page,
    YouTube uses an iframe tag to encapsulate the video. There are several options parameters you can use to customize
    the look and use of the embedded YouTube player.</p>

<h2>Can you display videos using YouTube's video player from outside of YouTube?</h2>
<p>You can embed YouTube videos very easily, just by copying some code that they will provide if you know where to find
    it. Everything I've found online says you can't use YouTube's video player to play non-YouTube videos though. There
    was one stackoverflow question
    (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39297657/how-to-use-youtube-player-to-play-local-video-files-on-my-server),
    where a guy said you can if you upload your video to Google Drive, but since Google owns YouTube, you are basically
    uploading the video to YouTube by doing that.</p>
