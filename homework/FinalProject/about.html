            <h2>The Coffee</h2>
            <div class="aboutleft"><br>
            <p>Blerg and Yerma came up with the idea for Zanzibar's Coffee House while on a spiritual quest in the
                Appalachian Mountains.
                They were struck with gold when the idea of fresh coffee and live music popped into their minds after a
                long hike. Once their
                quest was over, Blerg and Yerma came home to begin their experimental roasting process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Blerg and Yerma spent years trying new roasting ideas until they found the perfect times and temperatures
                for their
                signature blend. Named after Yerma's childhood dog, "Sonny", the first signature roast has become a hit
                with local audiences.
                Since their initial opening in 2012, Blerg and Yerma have created two more unique blends to fit the
                tastebuds of coffee
                connoisseurs everywhere. </p>
            <br>
                <p><span class="highlight">Sonny</span> is a medium roast coffee, featuring hints of rose and cinnamon.</p>
            <br>
                <p><span class="highlight">Trumble</span> is a dark roast coffee with high caffeine content and notes of cocoa.</p>
            <br>
                <p><span class="highlight">Whipper</span> is a light roast coffee laced with vanilla and nougat tones.</p>

        <h2 class="clear">The Owners</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Blerg grew up in Southern Missouri with his fourteen brothers and sisters. He began farming as a young child,
            but soon realized his true passions align with those his family referred to as "City Folk." Once he turned
            18, Blerg
            moved to St. Paul but was met with the harsh reality of winter. He suffered extreme frostbite on his left
            foot, and
            needed amputation, which he could not afford as a young adult in his late teens.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In comes Yerma, who found Blerg weeping on the side of the road. The two quickly became friends, and Yerma,
            because
            of her wealthy upbringing and successful stint in investment banking, was able to pay for Blerg's foot
            amputation.
            The two have been inseparable ever since.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Blerg and Yerma now reside in an apartment in Downtown St. Paul, and they run Zanzibar's Coffee House
            together, with
            the help of their friends and community. Blerg and Yerma enjoy traveling around the continental U.S., and
            Blerg hopes to
            be an inspiration for those who love to hike but may be limited by their number of limbs.</p>
