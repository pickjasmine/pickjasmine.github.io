<h1>Regular Expressions in JavaScript and jQuery</h1>

<p>What commands in Javascript are used to process Regular Expressions? Please list the commands and describe their
    functionality.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>regexp.exec(string)</dt>
    <dd>Does a search through the string, and returns an array of values if any matches are found.
        Returns null is there are no matches.
    </dd>

    <dt>regexp.test(string)</dt>
    <dd>tests the string and sees if it matches the regex, returning a boolean</dd>

    <dt>string.match(regexp pattern)</dt>
    <dd>searches string for a match of the pattern, returning an array of the results. You must include the gloabl
        flag (g) if you want to have more than one result in the array.
    </dd>

    <dt>string.search(regexp pattern)</dt>
    <dd>searches string for a match of the pattern, returning beginning index of the match if it is found. Returns -1 if
        no matches are found.
    </dd>

    <dt>string.replace(regexp pattern, string)</dt>
    <dd>searches string for a match of the pattern, replacing the entire match with the string parameter</dd>

    <dt>string.split(regexp pattern)</dt>
    <dd>searches string for a match of the pattern, dividing the string into an array at every pattern match.</dd>
</dl>

<p>What commands in JQuery are used to process Regular Expressions? Please list the commands and describe their
    functionality.</p>
<p>jQuery recommends using JavaScript when processing regular expressions because JavaScript already has premade
    functions for regular expressions and strings.</p>

<p>What do they mean when they use the term 'pattern' with Regular Expressions?</p>
<p>The patterns in regular expressions are used to detect strings. The patterns are made up
    of symbols and characters that outline a "pattern" that the string must match in order to match the regex.</p>
