<h1>Google Analytics</h1>

<h2>What are analytic tools and in general how do they work?</h2>
<p>Analytic tools are tools that you can implement on a website to track information about your visitors. For Google
    Analytics, you register a website and are giving a unique tracking code to insert onto a page. This snippet of
    JavaScript code runs in the browser whenever someone visits that website, collects data about the visit/visitor, and
    sends it back to Google for interpretation. The script can also place a cookie on the visitors machine to keep track
    of their return to a site.This is a very general idea of what Google Analytics does for their free
    tier users. Google also provides enterprise and 360 editions of their analytics software that perform enhanced
    analysis of the information gathered from website visitors.
</p>

<h2>What type of information do they provide to the website owner?</h2>
<p>Google Analytics tracks a ton of information about each visitor to a site. Some of things they track are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Age of visitor</li>
    <li>Location of visitor</li>
    <li>Gender of visitor</li>
    <li>Possible interests of visitor</li>
    <li>Length of time spent on site</li>
    <li>How the visitor came to your site (through a link or direct URL)</li>
    <li>Type of browser visitor is using</li>
    <li>Device visitor is using (mobile, desktop, tablet)</li>
    <li>Heat mapping (where the user's attention was drawn)</li>
    <li>New or returning user</li>

</ul>
<p>All of the things listed above are then conveniently visualized for the site owner into graphs and easily understood
    numbers. The paid tiers of analytics will provide more insight into how to optimize your site for peak visit time,
    traffic analysis, etc. The free tier will only give you the visuals of the information gathered (I believe, but I could be wrong). </p>
