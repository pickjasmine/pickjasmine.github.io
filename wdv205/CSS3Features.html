<h1>10 CSS3 Features</h1>

<div class="main">
<dl>
    <dt>1. Multiple Backgrounds</dt>
    <dd>This features allows you to insert multiple background images into your webpage. You might use this feature if
        you want to put an image in both the top right and bottom right.  This is demonstrated on this page; the wood pattern is the
        first background-image used.  All of the values for the wood pattern are listed first, followed by a comma and the values for
        the second background-image (the lightbulb).</dd>
    <dt>2. Rounded Corners</dt>
    <dd>Rounded corners are utilized through the border-radius property.  You can use this feature to make any box within
        your body rounded, or you can use this feature to create circles as the background. This is demonstrated on this page around
        this list you are currently reading and the H1 title, "10 CSS3 Features." You can apply this property to any element you want.</dd>
    <dt>3. Text Shadow</dt>
    <dd>Text shadow is achieved using the text-shadow property. You might use Text Shadowing on header tags or other important
        pieces of information that you want to stand out on your webpage. Text shadowing is done on the header for this page,
        "10 CSS3 Features".</dd>
    <dt>4. Box Shadows</dt>
    <dd>Similar to text shadows, box shadow is used when you want to draw attention to a specific element, like maybe a
        sidebar or a navigation menu.  Box Shadow is created using the box-shadow property.</dd>
    <dt>5. Border Images</dt>
    <dd>CSS3 allows the use of images in borders and border corners, using the border-image and border-corner-image properties.
        You might use this feature when you are trying to draw attention to a block of text or an important section of a website.</dd>
    <dt>6. Flex-box</dt>
    <dd>Flex-box allows you to do what floats do but easier.  Using this feature will allow you to fill and utilize
        the entire container object. Flex-box makes it so content will not drop below other content if you make any one object
        too wide. You would likely use flex-box to give your page a 2+ column layout that will adapt to all screen sizes. </dd>
    <dt>7. Opacity</dt>
    <dd>Opacity could be used to mute the colors of an image to create a sort of "ambiance" on your webpage, but it can
        also be used to make your text more readable if the text is in front of a background image. Opacity is achieved using the
        opacity property.</dd>
    <dt>8. Multiple Columns</dt>
    <dd>Multiple columns do exactly what it sounds like, creates columns out of text. Declare "moz-column-count" and "moz-column-width"
        to achieve this effect. This feature is applied in the same way as other style rules, so you would likely only use it on a single
        large block of texts, not to style your entire webpage.</dd>
    <dt>9. Transitions</dt>
    <dd>Transitions allow you to change between one specified property value to another, with specified lengths of time and delays as
        well.  You might use this on a navigation menu or on any element that you might want to make more fun and eye-catching. You
        can achieve transitions using the transition property on the desired element(not the desired element:hover pseudo-class).</dd>
    <dt>10. Blend Mode</dt>
    <dd>Blend Mode is essentially adding a filter to your images. You can use blend mode to achieve gradient pictures and
        backgrounds. Blend Mode is great for retina and other high-def screens because the color blends are generated while loading
        the page.  You might use blend mode to make a group of images look uniform (with the same blend mode applied).</dd>
